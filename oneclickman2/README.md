# One-click Man II
<br />Just an experiment, really. A basic incremental/clicker game which sort of parodies/pays homage to manga series like DBZ 
and One-punch man. I'll probably keep adding to this as a testing ground whenever I have time, or a new idea takes me.
<br />This is the second version, I won't be making many changes to version one from this point on.
